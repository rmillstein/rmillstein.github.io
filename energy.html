	<DT><A HREF="http://www.doe.gov/">U. S. Department of Energy</A>

		<DD>This web site is the official propaganda page 
for the Department of Energy.  It provides links to the various offices in the 
Department such as those responsible for research, policy, and public 
education.  There are links to the various National Laboratories (Los 
Alamos, Lawrence Livermore, Oak Ridge, etc.) with details about the types 
of research that they are performing.  In addition, there is a link (OpenNet) 
to the new program which involves declassification of secret experiments 
that the government performed on people in the past (no mention of current 
experiments on the population!).<BR><BR>

	<DT><A HREF="http://www.energy.ca.gov/">California Energy Commission</A>
		<DD>This organization is the state's agency that 
deals with energy policy and planning.  This site is slick and has a lot of 
information on different projects in California.  Especially interesting are 
links to some of the renewable energy resources and alternative vehicles.  
Also, there is information about the deregulation of the electrical utility 
industry in California.  There are links to providers of &#34;renewable&#34; energy 
that consumers can choose as their utility company 
(see <A HREF="http://www.energy.ca.gov/greenpower/providers.html">
http://www.energy.ca.gov/greenpower/providers.html</A>).<BR><BR>


	<DT><A HREF="http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/">California Public Utilities Commission</A>
		<DD>This is mostly a &#34;nuts and bolts&#34; 
agency that controls how utility companies can deal with the public -- i.e., 
rates, complaints, etc.  However, there is some information about energy 
supply and deregulation.<BR><BR>


	<DT><A HREF="http://www.citizen.org/CMEP/">Public Citizen's Critical Mass Energy Project</A>
		<DD>Public Citizen is a large 
private &#34;government watch-dog&#34; organization.  This web site deals
specifically with energy and related issues such as nuclear waster disposal.  
In addition, it provides a lot of links to other similar organizations and 
sites that deal with specific topics such as renewable energy, nuclear 
waste, energy efficiency, and transportation. <BR><BR> 


	<DT><A HREF="http://solstice.crest.org/index.shtml">
	Center for Renewable Energy and Sustainable Technology (CREST)</A>
		<DD>This is a 
private organization devoted to energy policy and issues.  It also deals with 
some issues of international importance.  There are many links to other 
sites.  This is a decidedly &#34;liberal&#34; site. <BR><BR>


	<DT><A HREF="http://zebu.uoregon.edu/energy.html">Energy and the Environment webpage 
	from the Environmental Studies Program at the University of Oregon</A>
		<DD>This site provides a lot of information 
about the basics of energy resources and electricity.  An excellent site!<BR><BR>


	<DT><A HREF="http://www.pge.com/">Pacific Gas and Electric</A>
		<DD>This is the corporate (public relations) webpage.  
It provides information on the company as well as the sources of electricity 
within its grid.  In addition, it provides information on specific plants such 
as Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant and the Geysers Geothermal Power 
Plant.<BR><BR>

	<DT><A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/Science/Energy/">Yahoo's Energy Links</A>
		<DD>This page in the popular Web search engine Yahoo! has a list of energy 
websites dealing with everything from alternative fuels to fusion power to 
environmental issues.<BR><BR>


	<DT><A HREF="http://www.rmi.org">Rocky Mountain Institute</A>
		<DD>Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) is a nonprofit research and educational foundation 
		whose stated mission is to foster the efficient and sustainable use of resources 
		as a path to global security.  RMI was established in 1982 by resource analysts 
		Hunter and Amory Lovins (proponents of &#34;soft&#34; energy).<BR><BR>
