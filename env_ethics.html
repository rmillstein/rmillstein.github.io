	<DT><A HREF="http://www.utc.edu/%7Eiaep/">International Association for Environmental Philosophy (IAEP)</A></DT>

	<DT><A HREF="http://divweb.harvard.edu/csvpl/ee/bib/">The Subject Bibliographies in 
	Environmental Ethics</A></DT>
		<DD>&#34;The Subject Bibliographies in Environment Ethics are
       published by Timothy C. Weiskel for the Center for the Study of Values
       in Public Life at Harvard Divinity School. They are intended to facilitate
       research and public discussion of the ethical issues embedded in the
       environmental concerns of our day. Developed initially as teaching and
       research aids for seminars on environmental ethics taught at Harvard, they
       are presented on this web site as general resources for public use. They are
       arranged in three separate series: the Class Bibliography Series; the
       Subject Bibliography Series; and the Occasional Bibliography Series.&#34;<BR><BR></DD>
     

	<DT><A HREF="http://www.cep.unt.edu/novice.html">History of Environmental Ethics</A></DT>
		<DD>Environmental ethics is a relatively new field in philosophy.  This brief survey
		gives an overview of the history of the field in philosophy.  It is useful in providing
		a context for discussions in environmental ethics, as well as pointing out key issues,
		individuals, papers, and books in the field.  Also contains links to other
		environmental ethics resources.<BR><BR></DD>
