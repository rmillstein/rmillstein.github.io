<h1>On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation 
of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life (1859; first edition)</h1>
<h2>Charles Darwin</h2>

<h3>Chapter 3 - Struggle for Existence (excerpt -- pp. 60-76)</h3>

<P>
BEF0RE entering on the
subject of this chapter, I must make a few preliminary remarks, to
show how the struggle for existence bears on Natural Selection. It has
been seen in the last chapter that amongst organic beings in a state
of nature there is some individual variability; indeed I am not aware
that this has ever been disputed. It is immaterial for us whether a
multitude of doubtful forms be called species or sub-species or
varieties; what rank, for instance, the two or three hundred doubtful
forms of British plants are entitled to hold, if the existence of any
well-marked varieties be admitted. But the mere existence of
individual variability and of some few well-marked varieties, though
necessary as the foundation for the work, helps us but little in
understanding how species arise in nature. How have all those
exquisite adaptations of one part of the organisation to another part,
and to the conditions of life, and of one distinct organic being to
another being, been perfected? We see these beautiful co-adaptations
most plainly in the woodpecker and missletoe; and only a little less
plainly in the humblest parasite which clings 
to the hairs of a
quadruped or feathers of a bird; in the structure of the beetle which
dives through the water; in the plumed seed which is wafted by the
gentlest breeze; in  short, we see beautiful adaptations
everywhere and in every part of the organic world.
</P>
<P>
Again, it may be asked, how is it that varieties, which I have
called incipient species, become ultimately converted into good and
distinct species, which in most cases obviously differ from each other
far more than do the varieties of the same species? How do those
groups of species, which constitute what are called distinct genera,
and which differ from each other more than do the species of the same
genus, arise? All these results, as we shall more fully see in the
next chapter, follow inevitably from the struggle for life. Owing to
this struggle for life, any variation, however slight and from
whatever cause proceeding, if it be in any degree profitable to an
individual of any species, in its infinitely complex relations to
other organic beings and to external nature, will tend to the
preservation of that individual, and will generally be inherited by
its offspring. The offspring, also, will thus have a better chance of
surviving, for, of the many individuals of any species which are
periodically born, but a small number can survive. I have called this
principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by
the term of Natural Selection, in order to mark its relation to man's
power of selection. We have seen that man by selection can certainly
produce great results, and can adapt organic beings to his own uses,
through the accumulation of slight but useful variations, given to him
by the hand of Nature. But Natural Selection, as we shall hereafter
see, is a power incessantly ready for action, and is as immeasurably
superior to man's feeble efforts, as the works of Nature are to those
of Art.
</P>
<P>
We will now discuss in a little more detail the struggle for
existence. In my future work this subject shall be treated, as it well
deserves, at much greater length. The elder De Candolle and Lyell have
largely and philosophically shown that all organic beings are exposed
to severe competition. In regard to plants, no one has treated this
subject with more spirit and ability than W. Herbert, Dean of
Manchester, evidently the result of his great horticultural knowledge.
Nothing is easier than to admit in words the truth of the universal
struggle for life, or more difficult   at least I have found it
so   than constantly to bear  this conclusion in
mind. Yet unless it be thoroughly engrained in the mind, I am
convinced that the whole economy of nature, with every fact on
distribution, rarity, abundance, extinction, and variation, will be
dimly seen or quite misunderstood. We behold the face of nature bright
with gladness, we often see superabundance of food; we do not see, or
we forget, that the birds which are idly singing round us mostly live
on insects or seeds, and are thus constantly destroying life; or we
forget how largely these songsters, or their eggs, or their nestlings
are destroyed by birds and beasts of prey; we do not always bear in
mind, that though food may be now superabundant, it is not so at all
seasons of each recurring year.
</P>
<P>
I should premise that I use the term Struggle for Existence in a
large and metaphorical sense, including dependence of one being on
another, and including (which is more important) not only the life of
the individual, but success in leaving progeny. Two canine animals in
a time of dearth, may be truly said to struggle with each other which
shall get food and live. But a plant on the edge of a desert is said
to struggle for life against the drought, though more properly it
should be said to be dependent on the moisture. A plant which annually
produces a thousand seeds, of which on an average only one comes to
maturity, may be more truly said to struggle with the plants of the
same and other kinds which already clothe the ground. The missletoe is
dependent on the apple and a few other trees, but can only in a
far-fetched sense be said to struggle with these trees, for if too
many of these parasites grow on the same tree, it will languish and
die. But several seedling missletoes, growing close together on the
same branch, may more truly be said to struggle with each other. As
the missletoe is disseminated by birds, its existence depends on
birds; and it may metaphorically be said to struggle with other
fruit-bearing plants, in order to tempt birds to devour and thus
disseminate its seeds rather than those of other plants. In these
several senses, which pass into each other, I use for convenience sake
the general term of struggle for existence.
</P>
<P>
A struggle for existence inevitably follows from the high rate at
which all organic beings tend to increase. Every being, which
during its natural lifetime produces several eggs or seeds,
must suffer destruction during some period of its life, and during
some season or occasional year, otherwise, on the principle of
geometrical increase, its numbers would quickly become so inordinately
great that no country could support the product. Hence, as more
individuals are produced than can possibly survive, there must in
every case be a struggle for existence, either one individual with
another of the same species, or with the individuals of distinct
species, or with the physical conditions of life. It is the doctrine
of Malthus applied with manifold force to the whole animal and
vegetable kingdoms; for in this case there can be no artificial
increase of food, and no prudential restraint from marriage. Although
some species may 
be now increasing, more or less rapidly, in numbers,
all cannot do so, for the world would not hold them.
</P>
<P>
There is no exception to the rule that every organic being
naturally increases at so high a rate, that if not destroyed, the
earth would soon be covered by the progeny of a single pair. Even
slow-breeding man has doubled in twenty-five years, and at this rate,
in a few thousand years, there would literally not be standing room
for his progeny. Linnaeus has calculated that if an annual plant
produced only two seeds   and there is no plant so unproductive
as this   and their seedlings next year produced two, and so on,
then in twenty years there would be a million plants. The elephant is
reckoned to be the slowest breeder of all known animals, and I have
taken some pains to estimate its probable minimum rate of natural
increase: it will be under the mark to assume that it breeds when
thirty years old, and goes on breeding till ninety years old, bringing
forth three pairs of young in this interval; if this be so, at the end
of the fifth century there would be alive fifteen million elephants,
descended from the first pair.
</P>
<P>
But we have better evidence on this subject than mere theoretical
calculations, namely, the numerous recorded cases of the astonishingly
rapid increase of various animals in a state of nature, when
circumstances have been favourable to them during two or three
following seasons.  Still more striking is the evidence from our
domestic animals of many kinds which have  run wild in
several parts of the world: if the statements of the rate of increase
of slow-breeding cattle and horses in South America, and latterly in
Australia, had not been well authenticated, they would have been quite
incredible. So it is with plants: cases could be given of introduced
plants which have become common throughout whole islands in a period
of less than ten years, Several of the plants now most numerous over
the wide plains of La Plata, clothing square leagues of surface almost
to the exclusion of all other plants, have been introduced from
Europe; and there are plants which now range in India, as I hear from
Dr Falconer, from Cape Comorin to the Himalaya, which have been
imported from America since its discovery. In such cases, and endless
instances could be given, no one supposes that the fertility of these
animals or plants has been suddenly and temporarily increased in any
sensible degree. The obvious explanation is that the conditions of
life have been very favourable, and that there has consequently been
less destruction of the old and young, and that nearly all the young
have been enabled to breed. In such cases the geometrical ratio of
increase, the result of which never fails to be surprising, simply
explains the extraordinarily rapid increase and wide diffusion of
naturalised productions in their new homes.
</P>
<P>
In a state of nature almost every plant produces seed, and amongst
animals there are very few which do not annually pair. Hence we may
confidently assert, that all plants and animals are tending to
increase at a geometrical ratio, that all would most rapidly stock
every station in which they could any how exist, and that the
geometrical tendency to increase must be checked by destruction at
some period of life. Our familiarity with the larger domestic animals
tends, I think, to mislead us: we see no great destruction falling on
them, and we forget that thousands are annually slaughtered for food,
and that in a state of nature an equal number would have somehow to be
disposed of.
</P>
<P>
The only difference between organisms which annually produce eggs
or seeds by the thousand, and those which produce extremely few, is,
that the slow-breeders would require a few more years to people, under
favourable conditions, a whole district, let it be ever
so large. The condor lays a couple of eggs and the ostrich a score,
and yet in the same country the condor may be the more numerous of the
two: the Fulmar petrel lays but one egg, yet it is believed to be the
most numerous bird in the world. One fly deposits hundreds of eggs,
and another, like the hippobosca, a single one; but this difference
does not determine how many individuals of the two species can be
supported in a district. A large number of eggs is of some importance
to those species, which depend on a rapidly fluctuating amount of
food, for it allows them rapidly to increase in number. But the real
importance of a large number of eggs or seeds is to make up for much
destruction at some period of life; and this period in the great
majority of cases is an early one. If an animal can in any way protect
its own eggs or young, a small number may be produced, and yet the
average stock be fully kept up; but if many eggs or young are
destroyed, many must be produced, or the species will become extinct.
It would suffice to keep up the full number of a tree, which lived on
an average for a thousand years, if a single seed were produced once
in a thousand years, supposing that this seed were never destroyed,
and could be ensured to germinate in a fitting place. So that in all
cases, the average number of any animal or plant depends only
indirectly on the number of its eggs or seeds.
</P>
<P>
In looking at Nature, it is most necessary to keep the foregoing
considerations always in mind   never to forget that every
single organic being around us may be said to be striving to the
utmost to increase in numbers; that each lives by a struggle at some
period of its life; that heavy destruction inevitably falls either on
the young or old, during each generation or at recurrent intervals.
Lighten any check, mitigate the 
destruction ever so little, and the
number of the species will almost instantaneously increase to any
amount. The face of Nature may be compared to a yielding surface, with
ten thousand sharp wedges packed close together and driven inwards by
incessant blows, sometimes one wedge being struck, and then another
with greater force.
</P>
<P>
What checks the natural tendency of each species to increase in
number is most obscure. Look at the most vigorous species;
by as much as it swarms in numbers, by so much will its
tendency to increase be still further increased. We know not exactly
what the checks are in even one single instance. Nor will this
surprise any one who reflects how ignorant we are on this head, even
in regard to mankind, so incomparably better known than any other
animal. This subject has been ably treated by several authors, and I
shall, in my future work, discuss some of the checks at considerable
length, more especially in regard to the feral animals of South
America.  Here I will make only a few remarks, just to recall to the
reader's mind some of the chief points. Eggs or very young animals
seem generally to suffer most, but this is not invariably the case.
With plants there is a vast destruction of seeds, but, from some
observations which I have made, I believe that it is the seedlings
which suffer most from germinating in ground already thickly stocked
with other plants. Seedlings, also, are destroyed in vast numbers by
various enemies; for instance, on a piece of ground three feet long
and two wide, dug and cleared, and where there could be no choking
from other plants, I marked all the seedlings of our native weeds as
they came up, and out of the 357 no less than 295 were destroyed,
chiefly by slugs and insects. If turf which has long been mown, and
the case would be the same with turf closely browsed by quadrupeds, be
let to grow, 
the more vigorous plants gradually kill the less
vigorous, though fully grown, plants: thus out of twenty species
growing on a little plot of turf (three feet by four) nine species
perished from the other species being allowed to grow up freely.
</P>
<P>
The amount of food for each species of course gives the extreme
limit to which each can increase; but very frequently it is not the
obtaining food, but the serving as prey to other animals, which
determines the average numbers of a species. Thus, there seems to be
little doubt that the stock of partridges, grouse, and hares on any
large estate depends chiefly on the destruction of vermin. If not one
head of game were shot during the next twenty years in England, and,
at the same time, if no vermin were destroyed, there would, in all
probability, be less game than at present, although hundreds of
thousands of game animals are now annually killed. On the other hand,
in some cases, as with  the elephant and rhinoceros, none
are destroyed by beasts of prey: even the tiger in India most rarely
dares to attack a young elephant protected by its dam.
</P>
<P>
Climate plays an important part in determining the average numbers
of a species, and periodical seasons of extreme cold or drought, I
believe to be the most effective of all checks. I estimated that the
winter of 1854-55 destroyed four-fifths of the birds in my own
grounds; and this is a tremendous destruction, when we remember that
ten per cent. is an extraordinarily severe mortality from epidemics
with man. The action of climate seems at first sight to be quite
independent of the struggle for existence; but in so far as climate
chiefly acts in reducing food, it brings on the most severe struggle
between the individuals, whether of the same or of distinct species,
which subsist on the same kind of food. Even when climate, for
instance extreme 
cold, acts directly, it will be the least vigorous,
or those which have got least food through the advancing winter, which
will suffer most. When we travel from south to north, or from a damp
region to a dry, we invariably see some species gradually getting
rarer and rarer, and finally disappearing; and the change of climate
being conspicuous, we are tempted to attribute the whole effect to its
direct action. But this is a very false view: we forget that each
species, even where it most abounds, is constantly suffering enormous
destruction at some period of its life, from enemies or from
competitors for the same place and food; and if these enemies or
competitors be in the least degree favoured by any slight change of
climate, they will increase in numbers, and, as each area is already
fully stocked with inhabitants, the other species will decrease. When
we travel southward and see a species decreasing in numbers, we may
feel sure that the cause lies quite as much in other species being
favoured, as in this one being hurt. So it is when we travel
northward, but in a somewhat lesser degree, for the number of species
of all kinds, and therefore of competitors, decreases northwards;
hence in going northward, or in ascending a mountain, we far oftener
meet with stunted forms, due to the <I>directly</I>
injurious action of climate, than we do in proceeding southwards or in
descending a mountain. When we reach the Arctic regions, or
snow-capped  summits, or absolute deserts, the struggle
for life is almost exclusively with the elements.
</P>
<P>
That climate acts in main part indirectly by favouring other
species, we may clearly see in the prodigious number of plants in our
gardens which can perfectly well endure our climate, but which never
become naturalised, for they cannot compete with our native plants,
nor resist destruction by our native animals.
</P>
<P>
When a species, owing to highly favourable circumstances, increases
inordinately in numbers in a small tract, epidemics   at least,
this seems generally to occur with our game animals   often
ensue: and here we have a limiting check independent of the struggle
for life. But even some of these so-called epidemics appear to be due
to parasitic worms, which have from some cause, possibly in part
through facility of diffusion amongst the crowded animals, been
disproportionably favoured: and here comes in a sort of struggle
between the parasite and its prey.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, in many cases, a large stock of individuals of
the same species, relatively to the numbers of its enemies, is
absolutely necessary for its preservation. Thus we can easily raise
plenty of corn and rape-seed, &amp;c., in our fields, because the
seeds are in great excess compared with the number of birds which feed
on them; nor can the birds, though having a superabundance of food at
this one season, increase in number proportionally to the supply of
seed, as their numbers are checked during winter: but any one who has
tried, knows how troublesome it is to get seed from a few wheat or
other such plants in a garden; I have in this case lost every single
seed. This view of the necessity of a large stock of the same species
for its preservation, explains, I believe, some singular facts in
nature, such as that of very rare plants being sometimes extremely
abundant in the few spots where they do occur; and that of some social
plants being social, that is, abounding in individuals, even on the
extreme confines of their range. For in such cases, we may believe,
that a plant could exist only where the conditions of its life were so
favourable that many could exist together, and thus save each other
from utter destruction. I should add that the good effects of frequent
intercrossing, and the ill effects 
of close interbreeding, probably
come into play in some of  these cases; but on this
intricate subject I will not here enlarge.
</P>
<P>
Many cases are on record showing how complex and unexpected are the
checks and relations between organic beings, which have to struggle
together in the same country.  I will give only a single instance,
which, though a simple one, has interested me. In Staffordshire, on
the estate of a relation where I had ample means of investigation,
there was a large and extremely barren heath, which had never been
touched by the hand of man; but several hundred acres of exactly the
same nature had been enclosed twenty-five years previously and planted
with Scotch fir. The change in the native vegetation of the planted
part of the heath was most remarkable, more than is generally seen in
passing from one quite different soil to another: not only the
proportional numbers of the heath-plants were wholly changed, but
twelve species of plants (not counting grasses and carices) flourished
in the plantations, which could not be found on the heath. The effect
on the insects must have been still greater, for six insectivorous
birds were very common in the plantations, which were not to be seen
on the heath; and the heath was frequented by two or three distinct
insectivorous birds. Here we see how potent has been the effect of the
introduction of a single tree, nothing whatever else having been done,
with the exception that the land had been enclosed, so that cattle
could not enter. But how important an element enclosure is, I plainly
saw near Farnham, in Surrey. Here there are extensive heaths, with a
few clumps of old Scotch firs on the distant hill-tops: within the
last ten years large spaces have been enclosed, and self-sown firs are
now springing up in multitudes, so close together that all cannot
live. 
When I ascertained that these young trees had not been sown or
planted, I was so much surprised at their numbers that I went to
several points of view, whence I could examine hundreds of acres of
the unenclosed heath, and literally I could not see a single Scotch
fir, except the old planted clumps. But on looking closely between the
stems of the heath, I found a multitude of seedlings and little trees,
which had been perpetually browsed down by the cattle. In one square
yard, at a point some hundreds yards distant from one of the old
clumps, I counted thirty-two little trees; and one  of
them, judging from the rings of growth, had during twenty-six years
tried to raise its head above the stems of the heath, and had failed.
No wonder that, as soon as the land was enclosed, it became thickly
clothed with vigorously growing young firs. Yet the heath was so
extremely barren and so extensive that no one would ever have imagined
that cattle would have so closely and effectually searched it for
food.
</P>
<P>
Here we see that cattle absolutely determine the existence of the
Scotch fir; but in several parts of the world insects determine the
existence of cattle. Perhaps Paraguay offers the most curious instance
of this; for here neither cattle nor horses nor dogs have ever run
wild, though they swarm southward and northward in a feral state; and
Azara and Rengger have shown that this is caused by the greater number
in Paraguay of a certain fly, which lays its eggs in the navels of
these animals when first born. The increase of these flies, numerous
as they are, must be habitually checked by some means, probably by
birds. Hence, if certain insectivorous birds (whose numbers are
probably regulated by hawks or beasts of prey) were to increase in
Paraguay, the flies would decrease   then cattle and horses
would become feral, and this would certainly greatly alter (as 
indeed
I have observed in parts of South America) the vegetation: this again
would largely affect the insects; and this, as we just have seen in
Staffordshire, the insectivorous birds, and so onwards in
ever-increasing circles of complexity. We began this series by
insectivorous birds, and we have ended with them. Not that in nature
the relations can ever be as simple as this. Battle within battle must
ever be recurring with varying success; and yet in the long-run the
forces are so nicely balanced, that the face of nature remains uniform
for long periods of time, though assuredly the merest trifle would
often give the victory to one organic being over another. Nevertheless
so profound is our ignorance, and so high our presumption, that we
marvel when we hear of the extinction of an organic being; and as we
do not see the cause, we invoke cataclysms to desolate the world, or
invent laws on the duration of the forms of life!
</P>
<P>
I am tempted to give one more instance showing how plants and
animals, most remote in the scale of nature, are bound 
together by a web of complex relations. I shall hereafter have
occasion to show that the exotic Lobelia fulgens, in this part of
England, is never visited by insects, and consequently, from its
peculiar structure, never can set a seed. Many of our orchidaceous
plants absolutely require the visits of moths to remove their
pollen-masses and thus to fertilise them. I have, also, reason to
believe that humble-bees are indispensable to the fertilisation of the
heartsease (Viola tricolor), for other bees do not visit this flower.
From experiments which I have tried, I have found that the visits of
bees, if not indispensable, are at least highly beneficial to the
fertilisation of our clovers; but humble-bees alone visit the common
red clover (Trifolium pratense), as other bees cannot reach the
nectar. Hence I have very little doubt, that if the whole genus of
humble-bees became 
extinct or very rare in England, the heartsease and
red clover would become very rare, or wholly disappear.  The number of
humble-bees in any district depends in a great degree on the number of
field-mice, which destroy their combs and nests; and Mr H. Newman, who
has long attended to the habits of humble-bees, believes that 'more
than two thirds of them are thus destroyed all over England.' Now the
number of mice is largely dependent, as every one knows, on the number
of cats; and Mr Newman says, 'Near villages and small towns I have
found the nests of humble-bees more numerous than elsewhere, which I
attribute to the number of cats that destroy the mice.' Hence it is
quite credible that the presence of a feline animal in large numbers
in a district might determine, through the intervention first of mice
and then of bees, the frequency of certain flowers in that district!
</P>

<P>
In the case of every species, many different checks, acting at different periods of life, and during different seasons or years, probably come into play; some one check or some few being generally the most potent, but all concurring in determining the average number or even the existence of the species. In some cases it can be shown that widely-different checks act on the same species in different districts. When we look at the plants and bushes clothing an entangled bank, we are tempted to attribute their proportional numbers and kinds to what we call chance. But how false a view is this! Every one has heard that when an American forest is cut down, a very different vegetation springs up; but it has been observed that the trees now growing on the ancient Indian mounds, in the Southern United States, display the same beautiful diversity and proportion of kinds as in the surrounding virgin forests. What a struggle between the several kinds of trees must here have gone on during long centuries, each annually scattering its seeds by the thousand; what war between insect and insect&mdash;between insects, snails, and other animals with birds and beasts of prey&mdash;all striving to increase, and all feeding on each other or on the trees or their seeds and seedlings, or on the other plants which first clothed the ground and thus checked the growth of the trees! Throw up a handful of feathers, and all must fall to the ground according to definite laws; but how simple is this problem compared to the action and reaction of the innumerable plants and animals which have determined, in the course of centuries, the proportional numbers and kinds of trees now growing on the old Indian ruins!
</P>

<P>
The dependency of one organic being on another, as of a parasite on its prey, lies generally between beings remote in the scale of nature. This is often the case with those which may strictly be said to struggle with each other for existence, as in the case of locusts and grass-feeding quadrupeds. But the struggle almost invariably will be most severe between the individuals of the same species, for they frequent the same districts, require the same food, and are exposed to the same dangers. In the case of varieties of the same species, the struggle will generally be almost equally severe, and we sometimes see the contest soon decided: for instance, if several varieties of wheat be sown together, and the mixed seed be resown, some of the varieties which best suit the soil or climate, or are naturally the most fertile, will beat the others and so yield more seed, and will consequently in a few years quite supplant the other varieties. To keep up a mixed stock of even such extremely close varieties as the variously coloured sweet-peas, they must be each year harvested separately, and the seed then mixed in due proportion, otherwise the weaker kinds will steadily decrease in numbers and disappear. So again with the varieties of sheep: it has been asserted that certain mountain-varieties will starve out other mountain-varieties, so that they cannot be kept together. The same result has followed from keeping together different varieties of the medicinal leech. It may even be doubted whether the varieties of any one of our domestic plants or animals have so exactly the same strength, habits, and constitution, that the original proportions of a mixed stock could be kept up for half a dozen generations, if they were allowed to struggle together, like beings in a state of nature, and if the seed or young were not annually sorted.
</P>

<P>
As species of the same genus have usually, though by no means invariably, some similarity in habits and constitution, and always in structure, the struggle will generally be more severe between species of the same genus, when they come into competition with each other, than between species of distinct genera. We see this in the recent extension over parts of the United States of one species of swallow having caused the decrease of another species. The recent increase of the missel-thrush in parts of Scotland has caused the decrease of the song-thrush. How frequently we hear of one species of rat taking the place of another species under the most different climates! In Russia the small Asiatic cockroach has everywhere driven before it its great congener. One species of charlock will supplant another, and so in other cases. We can dimly see why the competition should be most severe between allied forms, which fill nearly the same place in the economy of nature; but probably in no one case could we precisely say why one species has been victorious over another in the great battle of life.
</P>


<h3>Chapter 4 - Natural Selection (excerpt -- pp. 80-96)</h3>

<P>
How will the struggle for existence,
discussed too briefly in the last chapter, act in regard to variation?
Can the principle of selection, which we have seen is so potent in the
hands of man, apply in nature? I think we shall see that it can act
most effectually. Let it be borne in mind in what an endless number of
strange peculiarities our domestic productions, and, in a lesser
degree, those under nature, vary; and how strong the hereditary
tendency is. Under domestication, it may be truly said that the, whole
organisation becomes in some degree plastic. Let it be borne in mind
how infinitely complex and close-fitting are the mutual relations of
all organic beings to each other and to their physical conditions of
life. Can it, then, be thought improbable, seeing that variations
useful to man have undoubtedly occurred, that other variations useful
in some way to each being in the great and complex battle of life,
should sometimes occur in the course of thousands of generations?  If
such do occur, can we doubt (remembering 
that many more individuals
are born than can possibly survive) that individuals having any
advantage, however slight, over others, would have the best chance of
 surviving and of procreating their kind? On the other
hand, we may feel sure that any variation in the least degree
injurious would be rigidly destroyed. This preservation of favourable
variations and the rejection of injurious variations, I call Natural
Selection. Variations neither useful nor injurious would not be
affected by natural selection, and would be left a fluctuating
element, as perhaps we see in the species called polymorphic.
</P>
<P>
We shall best understand the probable course of natural selection
by taking the case of a country undergoing some physical change, for
instance, of climate. The proportional numbers of its inhabitants
would almost immediately undergo a change, and some species might
become extinct. We may conclude, from what we have seen of the
intimate and complex manner in which the inhabitants of each country
are bound together, that any change in the numerical proportions of
some of the inhabitants, independently of the change of climate
itself, would most seriously affect many of the others. If the country
were open on its borders, new forms would certainly immigrate, and
this also would seriously disturb the relations of some of the former
inhabitants. Let it be remembered how powerful the influence of a
single introduced tree or mammal has been shown to be. But in the case
of an island, or of a country partly surrounded by barriers, into
which new and better adapted forms could not freely enter, we should
then have 
places in the economy of nature which would assuredly be
better filled up, if some of the original inhabitants were in some
manner modified; for, had the area been open to immigration, these
same places would have been seized on by intruders. In such case,
every slight modification, which in the course of ages chanced to
arise, and which in any way favoured the individuals of any of the
species, by better adapting them to their altered conditions, would
tend to be preserved; and natural selection would thus have free scope
for the work of improvement.
</P>
<P>
We have reason to believe, as stated in the first chapter, that a
change in the conditions of life, by specially acting on the
reproductive system, causes or increases variability; and in the
foregoing case the conditions of life are supposed to have undergone a
change, and this would manifestly be favourable to 
natural selection, by giving a better chance of profitable variations
occurring; and unless profitable variations do occur, natural
selection can do nothing. Not that, as I believe, any extreme amount
of variability is necessary; as man can certainly produce great
results by adding up in any given direction mere individual
differences, so could Nature, but far more easily, from having
incomparably longer time at her disposal. Nor do I believe that any
great physical change, as of climate, or any unusual degree of
isolation to check immigration, is actually necessary to produce new
and unoccupied places for natural selection to fill up by modifying
and improving some of the varying inhabitants. For as all the
inhabitants of each country are struggling together with nicely
balanced forces, extremely slight modifications in the structure or
habits of one inhabitant would often give it an advantage over others;
and still further modifications of the same kind would often still
further increase the advantage. No country can be named in which all
the native inhabitants are now so perfectly adapted to each other and
to the physical conditions under which they live, that none of 
them
could anyhow be improved; for in all countries, the natives have been
so far conquered by naturalised productions, that they have allowed
foreigners to take firm possession of the land.  And as foreigners
have thus everywhere beaten some of the natives, we may safely
conclude that the natives might have been modified with advantage, so
as to have better resisted such intruders.
</P>
<P>
As man can produce and certainly has produced a great result by his
methodical and unconscious means of selection, what may not nature
effect? Man can act only on external and visible characters: nature
cares nothing for appearances, except in so far as they may be useful
to any being. She can act on every internal organ, on every shade of
constitutional difference, on the whole machinery of life.  Man
selects only for his own good; Nature only for that of the being
which she tends. Every selected character is fully exercised by her;
and the being is placed under well-suited conditions of life. Man
keeps the natives of many climates in the same country; he seldom
exercises each selected character in some peculiar and fitting manner;
he feeds a long and a short beaked pigeon on the same food; he does
not exercise  a long-backed or long-legged quadruped in
any peculiar manner; he exposes sheep with long and short wool to the
same climate.  He does not allow the most vigorous males to struggle
for the females. He does not rigidly destroy all inferior animals, but
protects during each varying season, as far as lies in his power, all
his productions. He often begins his selection by some half-monstrous
form; or at least by some modification prominent enough to catch his
eye, or to be plainly useful to him. Under nature, the slightest
difference of structure or constitution may well turn the
nicely-balanced scale in the 
struggle for life, and so be preserved.
How fleeting are the wishes and efforts of man!  how short his time!
and consequently how poor will his products be, compared with those
accumulated by nature during whole geological periods. Can we wonder,
then, that nature's productions should be far 'truer' in character
than man's productions; that they should be infinitely better adapted
to the most complex conditions of life, and should plainly bear the
stamp of far higher workmanship?
</P>
<P>
It may be said that natural selection is daily and hourly
scrutinising, throughout the world, every variation, even the
slightest; rejecting that which is bad, preserving and adding up all
that is good; silently and insensibly working, whenever and wherever
opportunity offers, at the improvement of each organic being in
relation to its organic and inorganic conditions of life. We see
nothing of these slow changes in progress, until the hand of time has
marked the long lapses of ages, and then so imperfect is our view into
long past geological ages, that we only see that the forms of life are
now different from what they formerly were.
</P>
<P>
Although natural selection can act only through and for the good of
each being, yet characters and structures, which we are apt to
consider as of very trifling importance, may thus be acted on.  When
we see leaf-eating insects green, and bark-feeders mottled-grey; the
alpine ptarmigan white in winter, the red-grouse the colour of
heather, and the black-grouse that of peaty earth, we must believe
that these tints are of service to these birds and insects in
preserving them from danger. Grouse, if not destroyed at some period
of their lives, would increase in countless numbers; they are known to
suffer largely from birds of  prey; and hawks are guided
by eyesight to their prey,   so much so, that on 
parts of the
Continent persons are warned not to keep white pigeons, as being the
most liable to destruction.  Hence I can see no reason to doubt that
natural selection might be most effective in giving the proper colour
to each kind of grouse, and in keeping that colour, when once
acquired, true and constant. Nor ought we to think that the occasional
destruction of an animal of any particular colour would produce little
effect: we should remember how essential it is in a flock of white
sheep to destroy every lamb with the faintest trace of black. In
plants the down on the fruit and the colour of the flesh are
considered by botanists as characters of the most trifling importance:
yet we hear from an excellent horticulturist, Downing, that in the
United States smooth-skinned fruits suffer far more from a beetle, a
curculio, than those with down; that purple plums suffer far more from
a certain disease than yellow plums; whereas another disease attacks
yellow-fleshed peaches far more than those with other coloured flesh.
If, with all the aids of art, these slight differences make a great
difference in cultivating the several varieties, assuredly, in a state
of nature, where the trees would have to struggle with other trees and
with a host of enemies, such differences would effectually settle
which variety, whether a smooth or downy, a yellow or purple fleshed
fruit, should succeed.
</P>
<P>
In looking at many small points of difference between species,
which, as far as our ignorance permits us to judge, seem to be quite
unimportant, we must not forget that climate, food, &amp;c., probably
produce some slight and direct effect. It is, however, far more
necessary to bear in mind that there are many unknown laws of
correlation of growth, which, when one part of the organisation is
modified through variation, and the modifications are accumulated by
natural selection for 
the good of the being, will cause other
modifications, often of the most unexpected nature.
</P>
<P>
As we see that those variations which under domestication appear at
any particular period of life, tend to reappear in the offspring at
the same period;   for instance, in the seeds of the many
varieties of our culinary and agricultural plants; in the 
caterpillar and cocoon stages of the varieties of the silkworm; in the
eggs of poultry, and in the colour of the down of their chickens; in
the horns of our sheep and cattle when nearly adult;   so in a
state of nature, natural selection will be enabled to act on and
modify organic beings at any age, by the accumulation of profitable
variations at that age, and by their inheritance at a corresponding
age. If it profit a plant to have its seeds more and more widely
disseminated by the wind, I can see no greater difficulty in this
being effected through natural selection, than in the cotton-planter
increasing and improving by selection the down in the pods on his
cotton-trees.  Natural selection may modify and adapt the larva of an
insect to a score of contingencies, wholly different from those which
concern the mature insect. These modifications will no doubt affect,
through the laws of correlation, the structure of the adult; and
probably in the case of those insects which live only for a few hours,
and which never feed, a large part of their structure is merely the
correlated result of successive changes in the structure of their
larvae. So, conversely, modifications in the adult will probably often
affect the structure of the larva; but in all cases natural selection
will ensure that modifications consequent on other modifications at a
different period of life, shall not be in the least degree injurious:
for if they became so, they would cause the extinction of the species.
</P>
<P>
Natural selection will modify the structure of the 
young in
relation to the parent, and of the parent in relation to the young. In
social animals it will adapt the structure of each individual for the
benefit of the community; if each in consequence profits by the
selected change. What natural selection cannot do, is to modify the
structure of one species, without giving it any advantage, for the
good of another species; and though statements to this effect may be
found in works of natural history, I cannot find one case which will
bear investigation. A structure used only once in an animal's whole
life, if of high importance to it, might be modified to any extent by
natural selection; for instance, the great jaws possessed by certain
insects, and used exclusively for opening the cocoon   or the
hard tip to the beak of nestling birds, used for breaking the egg. It
has been asserted,  that of the best short-beaked
tumbler-pigeons more perish in the egg than are able to get out of it;
so that fanciers assist in the act of hatching. Now, if nature had to
make the beak of a full-grown pigeon very short for the bird's own
advantage, the process of modification would be very slow, and there
would be simultaneously the most rigorous selection of the young birds
within the egg, which had the most powerful and hardest beaks, for all
with weak beaks would inevitably perish: or, more delicate and more
easily broken shells might be selected, the thickness of the shell
being known to vary like every other structure.
</P>
<P>
Sexual Selection.&mdash;Inasmuch as peculiarities often appear under domestication in one sex and become hereditarily attached to that sex, the same fact probably occurs under nature, and if so, natural selection will be able to modify one sex in its functional relations to the other sex, or in relation to wholly different habits of life in the two sexes, as is sometimes the case with insects. And this leads me to say a few words on what I call Sexual Selection. This depends, not on a struggle for existence, but on a struggle between the males for possession of the females; the result is not death to the unsuccessful competitor, but few or no offspring. Sexual selection is, therefore, less rigorous than natural selection. Generally, the most vigorous males, those which are best fitted for their places in nature, will leave most progeny. But in many cases, victory will depend not on general vigour, but on having special weapons, confined to the male sex. A hornless stag or spurless cock would have a poor chance of leaving offspring. Sexual selection by always allowing the victor to breed might surely give indomitable courage, length to the spur, and strength to the wing to strike in the spurred leg, as well as the brutal cock-fighter, who knows well that he can improve his breed by careful selection of the best cocks. How low in the scale of nature this law of battle descends, I know not; male alligators have been described as fighting, bellowing, and whirling round, like Indians in a war-dance, for the possession of the females; male salmons have been seen fighting all day long; male stag-beetles often bear wounds from the huge mandibles of other males. The war is, perhaps, severest between the males of polygamous animals, and these seem oftenest provided with special weapons. The males of carnivorous animals are already well armed; though to them and to others, special means of defence may be given through means of sexual selection, as the mane to the lion, the shoulder-pad to the boar, and the hooked jaw to the male salmon; for the shield may be as important for victory, as the sword or spear.
</P>

<P>
Amongst birds, the contest is often of a more peaceful character. All those who have attended to the subject, believe that there is the severest rivalry between the males of many species to attract by singing the females. The rock-thrush of Guiana, birds of Paradise, and some others, congregate; and successive males display their gorgeous plumage and perform strange antics before the females, which standing by as spectators, at last choose the most attractive partner. Those who have closely attended to birds in confinement well know that they often take individual preferences and dislikes: thus Sir R. Heron has described how one pied peacock was eminently attractive to all his hen birds. It may appear childish to attribute any effect to such apparently weak means: I cannot here enter on the details necessary to support this view; but if man can in a short time give elegant carriage and beauty to his bantams, according to his standard of beauty, I can see no good reason to doubt that female birds, by selecting, during thousands of generations, the most melodious or beautiful males, according to their standard of beauty, might produce a marked effect. I strongly suspect that some well-known laws with respect to the plumage of male and female birds, in comparison with the plumage of the young, can be explained on the view of plumage having been chiefly modified by sexual selection, acting when the birds have come to the breeding age or during the breeding season; the modifications thus produced being inherited at corresponding ages or seasons, either by the males alone, or by the males and females; but I have not space here to enter on this subject.
</P>

<P>
Thus it is, as I believe, that when the males and females of any animal have the same general habits of life, but differ in structure, colour, or ornament, such differences have been mainly caused by sexual selection; that is, individual males have had, in successive generations, some slight advantage over other males, in their weapons, means of defence, or charms; and have transmitted these advantages to their male offspring. Yet, I would not wish to attribute all such sexual differences to this agency: for we see peculiarities arising and becoming attached to the male sex in our domestic animals (as the wattle in male carriers, horn-like protuberances in the cocks of certain fowls, &amp;c.), which we cannot believe to be either useful to the males in battle, or attractive to the females. We see analogous cases under nature, for instance, the tuft of hair on the breast of the turkey-cock, which can hardly be either useful or ornamental to this bird;&mdash;indeed, had the tuft appeared under domestication, it would have been called a monstrosity.
</P>

<P>
Illustrations of the action of Natural Selection.&mdash;In order to make it clear how, as I believe, natural selection acts, I must beg permission to give one or two imaginary illustrations. Let us take the case of a wolf, which preys on various animals, securing some by craft, some by strength, and some by fleetness; and let us suppose that the fleetest prey, a deer for instance, had from any change in the country increased in numbers, or that other prey had decreased in numbers, during that season of the year when the wolf is hardest pressed for food. I can under such circumstances see no reason to doubt that the swiftest and slimmest wolves would have the best chance of surviving, and so be preserved or selected,&mdash;provided always that they retained strength to master their prey at this or at some other period of the year, when they might be compelled to prey on other animals. I can see no more reason to doubt this, than that man can improve the fleetness of his greyhounds by careful and methodical selection, or by that unconscious selection which results from each man trying to keep the best dogs without any thought of modifying the breed.
</P>

<P>
Even without any change in the proportional numbers of the animals on which our wolf preyed, a cub might be born with an innate tendency to pursue certain kinds of prey. Nor can this be thought very improbable; for we often observe great differences in the natural tendencies of our domestic animals; one cat, for instance, taking to catch rats, another mice; one cat, according to Mr. St. John, bringing home winged game, another hares or rabbits, and another hunting on marshy ground and almost nightly catching woodcocks or snipes. The tendency to catch rats rather than mice is known to be inherited. Now, if any slight innate change of habit or of structure benefited an individual wolf, it would have the best chance of surviving and of leaving offspring. Some of its young would probably inherit the same habits or structure, and by the repetition of this process, a new variety might be formed which would either supplant or coexist with the parent-form of wolf. Or, again, the wolves inhabiting a mountainous district, and those frequenting the lowlands, would naturally be forced to hunt different prey; and from the continued preservation of the individuals best fitted for the two sites, two varieties might slowly be formed. These varieties would cross and blend where they met; but to this subject of intercrossing we shall soon have to return. I may add, that, according to Mr. Pierce, there are two varieties of the wolf inhabiting the Catskill Mountains in the United States, one with a light greyhound-like form, which pursues deer, and the other more bulky, with shorter legs, which more frequently attacks the shepherd's flocks.
</P>

<P>
Let us now take a more complex case. Certain plants excrete a sweet juice, apparently for the sake of eliminating something injurious from their sap: this is effected by glands at the base of the stipules in some Leguminos&aelig;, and at the back of the leaf of the common laurel. This juice, though small in quantity, is greedily sought by insects. Let us now suppose a little sweet juice or nectar to be excreted by the inner bases of the petals of a flower. In this case insects in seeking the nectar would get dusted with pollen, and would certainly often transport the pollen from one flower to the stigma of another flower. The flowers of two distinct individuals of the same species would thus get crossed; and the act of crossing, we have good reason to believe (as will hereafter be more fully alluded to), would produce very vigorous seedlings, which consequently would have the best chance of flourishing and surviving. Some of these seedlings would probably inherit the nectar-excreting power. Those individual flowers which had the largest glands or nectaries, and which excreted most nectar, would be oftenest visited by insects, and would be oftenest crossed; and so in the long-run would gain the upper hand. Those flowers, also, which had their stamens and pistils placed, in relation to the size and habits of the particular insects which visited them, so as to favour in any degree the transportal of their pollen from flower to flower, would likewise be favoured or selected. We might have taken the case of insects visiting flowers for the sake of collecting pollen instead of nectar; and as pollen is formed for the sole object of fertilisation, its destruction appears a simple loss to the plant; yet if a little pollen were carried, at first occasionally and then habitually, by the pollen-devouring insects from flower to flower, and a cross thus effected, although nine-tenths of the pollen were destroyed, it might still be a great gain to the plant; and those individuals which produced more and more pollen, and had larger and larger anthers, would be selected.
</P>

<P>
When our plant, by this process of the continued preservation or natural selection of more and more attractive flowers, had been rendered highly attractive to insects, they would, unintentionally on their part, regularly carry pollen from flower to flower; and that they can most effectually do this, I could easily show by many striking instances. I will give only one&mdash;not as a very striking case, but as likewise illustrating one step in the separation of the sexes of plants, presently to be alluded to. Some holly-trees bear only male flowers, which have four stamens producing rather a small quantity of pollen, and a rudimentary pistil; other holly-trees bear only female flowers; these have a full-sized pistil, and four stamens with shrivelled anthers, in which not a grain of pollen can be detected. Having found a female tree exactly sixty yards from a male tree, I put the stigmas of twenty flowers, taken from different branches, under the microscope, and on all, without exception, there were pollen-grains, and on some a profusion of pollen. As the wind had set for several days from the female to the male tree, the pollen could not thus have been carried. The weather had been cold and boisterous, and therefore not favourable to bees, nevertheless every female flower which I examined had been effectually fertilised by the bees, accidentally dusted with pollen, having flown from tree to tree in search of nectar. But to return to our imaginary case: as soon as the plant had been rendered so highly attractive to insects that pollen was regularly carried from flower to flower, another process might commence. No naturalist doubts the advantage of what has been called the "physiological division of labour;" hence we may believe that it would be advantageous to a plant to produce stamens alone in one flower or on one whole plant, and pistils alone in another flower or on another plant. In plants under culture and placed under new conditions of life, sometimes the male organs and sometimes the female organs become more or less impotent; now if we suppose this to occur in ever so slight a degree under nature, then as pollen is already carried regularly from flower to flower, and as a more complete separation of the sexes of our plant would be advantageous on the principle of the division of labour, individuals with this tendency more and more increased, would be continually favoured or selected, until at last a complete separation of the sexes would be effected.
</P>

<P>
Let us now turn to the nectar-feeding insects in our imaginary case: we may suppose the plant of which we have been slowly increasing the nectar by continued selection, to be a common plant; and that certain insects depended in main part on its nectar for food. I could give many facts, showing how anxious bees are to save time; for instance, their habit of cutting holes and sucking the nectar at the bases of certain flowers, which they can, with a very little more trouble, enter by the mouth. Bearing such facts in mind, I can see no reason to doubt that an accidental deviation in the size and form of the body, or in the curvature and length of the proboscis, &amp;c., far too slight to be appreciated by us, might profit a bee or other insect, so that an individual so characterised would be able to obtain its food more quickly, and so have a better chance of living and leaving descendants. Its descendants would probably inherit a tendency to a similar slight deviation of structure. The tubes of the corollas of the common red and incarnate clovers (Trifolium pratense and incarnatum) do not on a hasty glance appear to differ in length; yet the hive-bee can easily suck the nectar out of the incarnate clover, but not out of the common red clover, which is visited by humble-bees alone; so that whole fields of the red clover offer in vain an abundant supply of precious nectar to the hive-bee. Thus it might be a great advantage to the hive-bee to have a slightly longer or differently constructed proboscis. On the other hand, I have found by experiment that the fertility of clover greatly depends on bees visiting and moving parts of the corolla, so as to push the pollen on to the stigmatic surface. Hence, again, if humble-bees were to become rare in any country, it might be a great advantage to the red clover to have a shorter or more deeply divided tube to its corolla, so that the hive-bee could visit its flowers. Thus I can understand how a flower and a bee might slowly become, either simultaneously or one after the other, modified and adapted in the most perfect manner to each other, by the continued preservation of individuals presenting mutual and slightly favourable deviations of structure.
</P>

<P>
I am well aware that this doctrine of natural selection, exemplified in the above imaginary instances, is open to the same objections which were at first urged against Sir Charles Lyell's noble views on "the modern changes of the earth, as illustrative of geology;" but we now very seldom hear the action, for instance, of the coast-waves, called a trifling and insignificant cause, when applied to the excavation of gigantic valleys or to the formation of the longest lines of inland cliffs. Natural selection can act only by the preservation and accumulation of infinitesimally small inherited modifications, each profitable to the preserved being; and as modern geology has almost banished such views as the excavation of a great valley by a single diluvial wave, so will natural selection, if it be a true principle, banish the belief of the continued creation of new organic beings, or of any great and sudden modification in their structure.
