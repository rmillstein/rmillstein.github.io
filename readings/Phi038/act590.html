<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:.4in;text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman">BE IT ENACTED
BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF ARKANSAS:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:.4in;text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman">SECTION 1.
Requirement for Balanced Treatment. Public schools within this State shall give
balanced treatment to creation-science and to evolution-science. Balanced
treatment to these two models shall be given in classroom lectures taken as a
whole for each course, in textbook materials taken as a whole for each course,
in library materials taken as a whole for the sciences and taken as a whole for
the humanities, and in other educational programs in public schools, to the
extent that such lectures, textbooks, library materials, or educational programs
deal in any way with the subject of the origin of man, life, the earth, or the
universe.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:.4in;text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman">SECTION 2.
Prohibition against Religious Instruction. Treatment of either evolution-science
or creation-science shall be limited to scientific evidences for each model and
inferences from those scientific evidences, and must not include any religious
instruction or references to religious writings.&nbsp;

</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:.4in;text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman">SECTION 3.
Requirement for Nondiscrimination. Public schools within this State, or their
personnel, shall not discriminate, by reducing a grade of a student or by
singling out and making public criticism, against any student who demonstrates a
satisfactory understanding of both evolution-science and creation-science and
who accepts or rejects either model in whole or part.&nbsp;

</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:.4in;text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman">SECTION 4.
Definitions. As used in this Act:
</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:.4in;text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a)
&quot;Creation-science&quot; means the scientific evidences for creation and
inferences from those scientific evidences. Creation-science includes the
scientific evidences and related inferences that indicate: (1) Sudden creation
of the universe, energy, and life from nothing; (2) The insufficiency of
mutation and natural selection in bringing about development of all living kinds
from a single organism; (3) Changes only within fixed limits of originally
created kinds of plants and animals; (4) Separate ancestry for man and apes; (5)
Explanation of the earth's geology by catastrophism, including the occurrence of
a worldwide flood; and (6) A relatively recent inception of the earth and living
kinds.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:.4in;text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)
&quot;Evolution-science&quot; means the scientific evidences for evolution and
inferences from those scientific evidences. Evolution-science includes the
scientific evidences and related
inferences that indicate: (1) Emergence by naturalistic processes of the
universe from disordered matter and emergence of life from nonlife; (2) The
sufficiency of mutation and natural selection in bringing about development of
present living kinds from simple earlier kinds; (3) Emergency [sic] by mutation
and natural selection of present living kinds from simple earlier kinds; (4)
Emergence of man from a common ancestor with apes; (3) Explanation of the
earth's geology and the evolutionary sequence by uniformitarianism; and (6) An
inception several billion years ago of the earth and somewhat later of life.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:.4in;text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)
&quot;Public schools&quot; mean public secondary and elementary schools.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:.4in;text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman">SECTION 5.
Clarifications. This Act does not require or permit instruction in any religious
doctrine or materials. This Act does not require any instruction in the subject
of origins, but simply requires instruction in both scientific models (of
evolution-science and creation-science) if public schools choose to teach
either. This Act does not require each individual textbook or library book to
give balanced treatment to the models of evolution-science and creation-science;
it does not require any school books to be discarded. This Act does not require
each individual classroom lecture in a course to give such balanced treatment,
but simply requires the lectures as a whole to give balanced treatment; it
permits some lectures to present evolution-science and other lectures to present
creation-science.&nbsp;

</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:.4in;text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman">SECTION 6.
Legislative Declaration of Purpose. This Legislature enacts this Act for public
schools with the purpose of protecting academic freedom for students' differing
values and beliefs; ensuring neutrality toward students' diverse religious
convictions; ensuring freedom of religious exercise for students and their
parents; guaranteeing freedom of belief and speech for students; preventing
establishment of Theologically Liberal, Humanist, Nontheist, or Atheist
religions; preventing discrimination against students on the basis of their
personal beliefs concerning creation and evolution; and assisting students in
their search for truth. This Legislature does not have the purpose of causing
instruction in religious concepts or making an establishment of religion.&nbsp;

</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:.4in;text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman">SECTION 7.
Legislative Findings of Fact. This Legislature finds that:</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:.4in;text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a) The
subject of the origin of the universe, earth, life, and man is treated within
many public school courses, such as biology, life science, anthropology,
sociology, and often also in physics, chemistry, world history, philosophy, and
social studies.</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:.4in;text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b) Only
evolution-science is presented to students in virtually all of those courses
that discuss the subject of origins. Public schools generally censor
creation-science and evidence contrary to evolution.</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:.4in;text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)
Evolution-science is not an unquestionable fact of science, because evolution
cannot be experimentally observed, fully verified, or logically falsified, and
because evolution-science is not accepted by some scientists.</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:.4in;text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(d)
Evolution-science is contrary to the religious convictions or moral values or
philosophical beliefs of many students and parents, including individuals of
many different religious faiths and with diverse moral values and philosophical
beliefs.</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:.4in;text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(e) Public
school presentation of only evolution-science without any alternative model of
origins abridges the United States Constitution's protections of freedom of
religious exercise and of freedom of belief and speech for students and parents,
because it undermines their religious convictions and moral or philosophical
values, compels their unconscionable professions of belief, and hinders
religious training and moral training by parents.</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:.4in;text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(f) Public
school presentation of only evolution-science furthermore abridges the
Constitution's prohibition against establishment of religion, because it
produces hostility toward many Theistic religions and brings preference to
Theological Liberalism, Humanism, Nontheistic religions, and Atheism, in that
these religious faiths general include a religious belief in evolution.</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:.4in;text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(g) Public
school instruction in only evolution-science also violates the principle of
academic freedom, because it denies students a choice between scientific models
and instead indoctrinates them in evolution-science alone.</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:.4in;text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(h)
Presentation of only one model rather than alternative scientific models of
origins is not required by any compelling interest of the State, and exemption
of such students from a course or
class presenting only evolution-science does not provide an adequate remedy
because of teacher influence and student pressure to remain in that course or
class.&nbsp;

</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:.4in;text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(i) Attendance
of those students who are at public schools is compelled by law, and school
taxes from their parents and other citizens are mandated by law.</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:.4in;text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(j)
Creation-science is an alternative scientific model of origins and can be
presented from a strictly scientific standpoint without any religious doctrine
just as evolution-science can, because there are scientists who conclude that
scientific data best support creation-science and because scientific evidences
and inferences have been presented for creation-science.</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:.4in;text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(k) Public
school presentation of both evolution-science and creation-science would not
violate the Constitution's prohibition against establishment of religion,
because it would involve presentation of the scientific evidences and related
inferences for each model rather than any religious instruction.</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:.4in;text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(l) Most
citizens, whatever their religious beliefs about origins, favor balanced
treatment in public schools of alternative scientific models of origins for
better guiding students in their search for knowledge, and they favor a neutral
approach toward subjects affecting the religious and moral and philosophical
convictions of students.</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:.4in;text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman">SECTION 8.
Short Title. This Act shall be known as the &quot;Balanced Treatment for
Creation-Science and Evolution-Science Act.&quot;&nbsp;

</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:.4in;text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman">SECTION 9.
Severability of Provisions. If any provision of this Act is held invalid, that
invalidity shall not affect other provisions that can be applied in the absence
of the invalidated provisions, and the provisions of this Act are declared to be
severable.

</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:.4in;text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman">SECTION 10.
Repeal of Contrary Laws. All State laws or parts of State laws in conflict with
this Act are hereby repealed.

</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:.4in;text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman">SECTION
11.
Effective Date. The requirements of the Act shall be met by and may be met
before the beginning of the next school year if that is more than six months
from the date of enactment,
or otherwise one year after the beginning of the next school year, and in all
subsequent school years.</font>
