The most influential position on these issues is found in the moral
philosophy of Immanuel Kant (1785, 1788, 1797). Indeed, most
contemporary discussions of respect for persons explicitly claim to
rely on, develop, or challenge some aspect of Kant's ethics. Central
to Kant's ethical theory is the claim that all persons are owed
respect just because they are persons, that is, free rational beings.
To be a person is to have a status and worth that is unlike that of
any other kind of being: it is to be an end in itself with
dignity. And the only response that is appropriate to such a being is
respect.  Respect (that is, moral recognition respect) is the
acknowledgement in attitude and conduct of the dignity of persons as
ends in themselves.  Respect for such beings is not only appropriate
but also morally and unconditionally required: the status and worth of
person is such that they must always be respected.  Because we are all
too often inclined not to respect persons, not to value them as they
ought to be valued, one formulation of the Categorical Imperative,
which is the supreme principle of morality, commands that our actions
express due respect for the worth of persons: &ldquo;Act in such a way
that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or the person of
any other, never simply as a means but always at the same time as an
end&rdquo; (<em>Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten</em>
(<em>Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Moral)</em> (1785), 4:429). Our
fundamental moral obligation, then, is to respect persons; morally
right actions are thus those that express respect for persons as ends
in themselves, while morally wrong actions are those that express
disrespect or contempt for persons by not valuing them as ends in
themselves (Wood 1999). In addition to this general commandment, Kant
argues that there are also more specific duties of respect for other
persons and self-respect, to which we'll return. For now, we must
address the question, What is it to be an end in itself and to possess
dignity?</p>

   

<p>

The concept of an end has several meanings for Kant.  In one sense, to
be an end is to have some kind of value or worth. Most things have
value as the objects of our desires, interests, or affections; they
are the ends we pursue or produce, our subjective ends. But the worth
of an end in itself is worth that is not relative to, conditional on,
or derived from being the object of anyone's desires or
affections. Rather, its worth is intrinsic to it, unconditional,
incomparable, and objective. Kant calls this distinctive worth which
only ends in themselves possess "dignity." In Kant's theory of value
dignity is the supreme value; thus ends in themselves are to be valued
morally above all other entities. Kant argues that rational beings are
the only entities that are ends in themselves and that all rational
beings are ends in themselves. The term "person" means a being whose
rational nature "already marks them out as ends in themselves...and an
object of respect" (Kant 1785, 4:428). In arguing for respect for the
dignity of persons, Kant explicitly rejects two other conceptions of
human value: the aristocratic idea of honor that individuals
differentially deserve according to their social rank, individual
accomplishments, or moral virtue (see Berger 1983 for a discussion of
the aristocratic dimensions of honor), and the view, baldly expressed
by Hobbes, that &ldquo;the value or worth of a man is, as of all other
things, his price &mdash; that is to say, so much as would be given
for the use of his power &mdash; and therefore is not absolute but a
thing dependent on the need and judgment of another&rdquo; (Hobbes
1958 (1651), 79). In <em>Die Metaphysik der Sitten (The Metaphysics of
Morals)</em> (1797) Kant grants that if we think of humans as merely
one kind of animal among others "in the system of nature," we can
ascribe a price to them, an extrinsic value that depends on their
usefulness; but, he argues, "a human being regarded as a person, that
is, as the subject of morally practical reason, is exalted above all
price...as an end in himself he possesses a <em>dignity</em> by which
he exacts <em>respect</em> for himself from all other beings in the
world" (<em>Metaphysics of Morals</em> 6:434-435). Against the
aristocratic view Kant argues that although individuals as members of
some social community or other may have or lack meritorious
accomplishment or status or may deserve honor (or evaluative respect)
to different degrees or not at all, all persons as members of the
moral community, the community of all and only ends in themselves, are
owed the same (moral recognition) respect, for the dignity that they
possesses as rational is unconditional and independent of all other
facts about or features of them. Dignity is also absolute and
incomparable worth: it can't be compared with, exchanged for, or
replaced by any other value, whereas the very purpose of a price is to
establish comparative value. And dignity is objective worth, which
means that it is a value that everyone has compelling reason to
acknowledge, regardless of their antecendent desires, interests, or
affections. This brings us to a second sense in which persons are ends
in themselvs. For "end" can also mean a limit or constraint on action
(as the end of the road puts a limit on our our travel). The rational
nature of persons "constitutes the supreme limiting condition of the
freedom of action of every human being" (<em>Groundwork</em> 4: 431);
it puts an absolute limit on how we can treat them. In particular,
they must never be treated merely as means, as things that we may use
however we want in order to advance our interests, and they must
always be treated as the supremely valuable beings that they are. Note
that it is not wrong to treat persons as means to our ends; indeed we
could not get along in life if we could not make use of the talents,
abilities, service, and labor of other people. What we must not do is
to treat persons as mere means to our ends, to treat them as if the
only value they have is what derives from their usefulness to us.  We
must always treat them "at the same time as an end."  To respect
persons is thus to regard them as absolutely, unconditionally, and
incomparably valuable, to value them in themselves and not just in
comparison to others or insofar as they are valuable to someone or
could be useful as a means for furthering some purpose, and to
acknowledge in a practical way that their dignity imposes absolute
constraints on our treatment of them.</p>

<p>

As the Categorical Imperative indicates, it is humanity in persons,
strictly speaking, that has dignity; that is, it is in virtue of the
humanity in them that people are and so ought to be treated as ends in
themselves.  Commentators generally identify humanity (that which
makes us distinctively human beings and sets us apart from all other
animal species) with two closely related aspects of rationality: the
capacity to set ends and the capacity to be autonomous, both of which
are capacities to be a moral agent (for example, Wood 1999, Korsgaard
1997, Hill 1997). The capacity to set ends, which is the power of
rational choice, is the capacity to value things through rational
judgment: to determine, under the influence of reason independently of
antecedent instincts or desires, that something is valuable or
important, that it is worth seeking or valuing. It is also, thereby,
the capacity to value ends in themselves, and so it includes the
capacity for respect (Velleman 1999). The capacity to be autonomous is
the capacity to be self-legislating and self-governing, that is, (a)
the capacity to legislate moral laws that are valid for all rational
beings through one's rational willing by recognizing, using reason
alone, what counts as a moral obligation, and (b) the capacity then to
freely resolve to act in accordance with moral laws because they are
self-imposed by one's own reason and not because one is compelled to
act by any forces external to one's reason and will, including one's
own desires and inclinations. The capacity to be autonomous is thus
also the capacity to freely direct, shape, and determine the meaning
of one's own life, and it is the condition for moral
responsibility. But why does the possession of these capacities make
persons ends in themselves? Kant argues that moral principles must be
categorical imperatives, which is to say that they must be rational
requirements to which we are unconditionally subject, regardless of
whatever inclinations, interests, goals, or projects we might
have. But there could be categorical imperatives only if there is
something of absolute worth. Only persons have this kind of worth, and
they have it because the capacity to set ends, or to confer value on
things, is the source of all objective value (as Korsgaard 1996 and
Wood 1999 have argued), and the capacity for autonomy is the source,
on the one hand, both of the obligatoriness of moral law and of
responsible moral actions, and on the other, of all realized human
goodness. As the sources of all value and of morality itself, then,
these rational capacities are the basis of the absolute worth or
dignity of rational beings. Kant maintains that all rational beings
necessarily attribute this value to themselves and that they must, on
reflection, acknowledge that every other rational being has the same
value and on the same grounds: because of the rational nature that is
common to all persons. It is thus not as members of the biological
species <em>homo sapiens</em> that we have dignity and so are owed
moral recognition respect, but as rational beings who are capable of
moral agency.</p>

<p>

There are several important consequences of this view regarding the
scope of respect for persons. First, while all normally functioning
human beings possess the rational capacities that ground respect,
there can be humans in whom these capacities are altogether absent and
who therefore are not persons and are not owed respect. Second, these
capacities may be possessed by beings who are not biologically human,
and such beings would also be persons with dignity whom we are morally
obligated to respect. Third, because dignity is an absolute worth
grounded in the rational capacities for morality, it is in no way
conditional on how well or badly those capacities are exercised, on
whether a person acts morally or has a morally good character or
not. Thus, dignity cannot be diminished or lost through vice or
morally bad action, nor can it be increased through virtue or morally
correct action. Because personhood and dignity are not matters of
degree, neither is respect. Once a person, always a person (barring,
say, brain death), and so individuals cannot forfeit dignity or the
right to respect no matter what they do.  It follows that even the
morally worst individuals must still be regarded as ends in themselves
and treated with respect. Of course, wrongdoing may call for
punishment and may be grounds for forfeiting certain rights, but it is
not grounds for losing dignity or for regarding the wrongdoer as
worthless scum. Respect is not something individuals have to earn or
might fail to earn, but something they are owed simply because they
are rational beings.  Finally, because dignity is absolute and
incomparable, the worth of all rational beings is equal. Thus the
morally worst persons have the same dignity as the morally best
persons, although the former, we might say, fail to live up to their
dignity. What grounds dignity is something that all persons have in
common, not something that distinguishes one individual from
another. Thus each person is to be respected as an equal among equals,
without consideration of their individual achievements or failures,
social rank, moral merit or demerit, or any feature other than their
common rational nature. However, the equality of all rational beings
does not entail that each person must be treated the same as every
other persons, nor does it entail that persons cannot also be
differentially evaluated and valued in other ways for their particular
qualities, accomplishments, merit, or usefulness. But such valuing and
treatment must always be constrained by the moral requirement to
respect persons as ends in themselves.</p>

<p>

In <em>Die Metaphysik der Sitten (The Metaphysics of Morals)</em>

(1797) Kant develops the implications of this view of persons as ends
in themselves. In his doctrine of justice he argues that persons, by
virtue of their rational nature, are bearers of fundamental rights,
including the innate right to freedom, which must be respected by
other persons and by social institutions. The dignity of persons also
imposes limits on permissible reasons for and forms of legal
punishment. In his doctrine of virtue, Kant discusses specific moral
duties of respect for other persons, as well as duties of
self-respect, to which we'll return below. Here, Kant explicitly
invokes the notion of respect as <em>observantia</em>. We have no
moral duty to feel respect for others, he holds, for we cannot have a
moral duty to have any feeling, since feelings are not directly
controllable by our will. Rather, the respect we owe others is
&ldquo;to be understood as the maxim of limiting our self-esteem by
the dignity of humanity in another person, and so as respect in the
practical sense&rdquo; (Kant 1797 (1991), 6:449).  This duty to
respect others requires two things: first, that we adopt as a
regulating policy a commitment to control our own desire to think well
of ourselves (this desire being the main cause of disrespect), and,
second, that we refrain from treating others in the following ways:
treating them merely as means (valuing them as less than ends in
themselves), showing contempt for them (denying that they have any
worth), treating them arrogantly (demanding that they value us more
highly than they value themselves), defaming them by publicly exposing
their faults, and ridiculing or mocking them. We also have duties of
love to others, and Kant argues that in friendship respect and love,
which naturally pull in opposite directions, achieve a perfect
balance.</p>

<p>

Subsequent work in a Kantian vein on the duty of respect for others
has expanded the list of ways that we are required by respect to treat
persons. In particular, although Kant says that the duties of respect
are strictly negative, consisting in not engaging in certain conduct
or having certain attitudes, many philosophers have argued that
respecting others involves positive actions and attitudes as well. The
importance of autonomy and agency in Kant's moral philosophy has led
many philosophers to highlight respect for autonomy.  Thus, we respect
others as persons (negatively) by doing nothing to impair or destroy
their capacity for autonomy, by not interfering with their autonomous
decisions and their pursuit of (morally acceptable) the ends they
value, and by not coercing or deceiving them or treating them
paternalistically.  We also respect them (positively) by protecting
them from threats to their autonomy (which may require intervention
when someone's current decisions seem to put their own autonomy at
risk) and by promoting autonomy and the conditions for it (for
example, by allowing and encouraging individuals to make their own
decisions, take responsibility for their actions, and control their
own lives).  Some philosophers have highlighted Kant's claim that
rationality is the ground for respect, arguing that to respect others
is to engage with them not as instruments or obstacles but as persons
who are to be reasoned with. So, for example, we should employ
considerations that are accessible to other persons and provide them
with genuine reasons in our dealings with them rather than trying to
manipulate them through nonrational techniques such as threat or
bribery, act toward them only in ways to which they could give
rational consent, and be willing to listen to them and take their
reasons seriously. The importance of the capacity to set ends and
value things has been taken by some philosophers to entail that
respect also involves consideration for the interests of others; so,
we should help them to promote and protect what they value and to
pursue their ends, provided these are compatible with due respect for
other persons, and we should make an effort to appreciate values that
are different from our own. Kant's emphasis in the doctrine of justice
on the fundamental rights that persons have has led still others to
view the duty to respect persons as the duty to respect the moral
rights they have as persons; some have claimed that the duty to
respect is nothing more than the duty to refrain from violating these
rights (Benn 1980, Feinberg 1970).</p>
