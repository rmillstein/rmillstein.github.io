<H1 class="title">Asking for a letter of recommendation</H1>



<H2 style="margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em;">Before requesting the letter:</H2>

<P>
Let me get to know you by participating in class discussion and/or by visiting my office hours.  Show genuine interest in, and insights about, the course material.  Of course, this requires that you come to class prepared, having done the course readings in advance.
</P>

<P>
Too late to do this?  I probably won't be able to write you a strong letter of recommendation, which in most cases, means that I shouldn't write you a letter at all.
</P>


<H2 style="margin-bottom:1em;">Requesting the letter:</H2>

<P>
It is best to do this in person, although sometimes (depending on the time of year, etc.) email is the only available route.  If you are emailing me and it has been awhile since I had you in class, attaching a picture would be helpful.
</P>

<P>
Do not wait until the deadline is imminent; again, I can make exceptions, but keep in mind that professors have very busy schedules (hint: not just teaching) and I will have to juggle deadlines to fit in your letter of recommendation.  It takes time to write a good letter of recommendation, especially if it's been awhile since I had you in class; it requires looking back on old assignments, email exchanges, etc., so that your letter contains specifics and not just platitudes about what a fantastic student you are.
</P>


<H2 style="margin-bottom:1em;">Be prepared to tell me:</H2>

<UL>
	<LI><B>what you want the letter for</B> &ndash; grad school, job, etc.</LI>
	<LI><B>what your goals are</B> &ndash; why you are going to grad school, why you want this job, etc.</LI>
	<LI><B>any particular skills, traits, or activities that you would like me to emphasize in your letter</B> &ndash; here it is good to know something about what the school or employer is looking for.</LI>
	<LI><B>the deadlines for the letters</B> &ndash; please do not make up deadlines.  If you would prefer the letter to be written earlier than the deadline specified by the letter requester, then please just say that.</LI>
	<LI>t<B>he web addresses, email addresses, or snail mail addresses where you would like the letter sent</B> &ndash; I will not give you the letter to do with as you wish in perpetuity; furthermore, most letter requesters will give more weight to letters that the candidate (i.e., you) has not seen.</LI>
	<LI><B>the assignments that you wrote for me of which you are the most proud</B> &ndash; please provide me with the assignments electronically or on paper.</LI>
</UL>

<P>
&nbsp;
</P>

<P>
I rarely refuse to write a letter; if I do, it's probably because I don't think I can write you a good one, so it is probably in your best interests not to insist.
</P>
